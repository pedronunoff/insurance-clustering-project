# Data Mining Project: A2Z Insurance Customer Clustering

This project was developed for the Data Mining course from the Master's Degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics (NOVA IMS).

The goal was to use Unsupervised Learning to cluster types of customers from a fictional insurance company in order to build a marketing strategy to increase profit and improve the company. The data from the clients had demographic and value related variables. All code was developed with Python.

## Main Steps (and main methods/algorithms)

- Data exploration with checks for inconsistencies, incoherencies, duplicates and outliers
- Preprocessing with encoding, imputing, dealing with previously found issues with the data, scaling and then feature engineering and selection (IQR, DBScan, kNN, MinMaxScaling, SOM, Hitmaps, UMAP, T-SNE)
- Clustering (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, SOM, K-Prototypes) 
- Marketing decisions based on cluster analysis.
